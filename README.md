# Xash3D-Emscripten
A re-upload of mittorn's [Emscripten](http://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/) port of the [Xash3D](https://github.com/FWGS/xash3d) engine, that can run Half-Life: Deathmatch within your web browser.

# Requirements / recommended specs
This app runs best in [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/).

#### Half-Life recommended specs:

* **CPU SPEED:** 250 MHz or higher
* **RAM:** 512 MB or more
* **OS:** Windows 7 or higher
* **GRAPHICS CARD:** 32 MB+ video card

>*(Keep in mind that these are NOT the game's actual minimum specs, they are just what is required to run the game in Firefox 57 and higher. You can run the game in older ESR releases, but Firefox Quantum is recommended for performance.)*
